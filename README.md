# Music Player #
Basic payer for  playing music, because I'm fed up with the players currently available :p
​
## Current situation ##
The Player is capable of extracting music files from storage and playing them.
Simple functionality of pause and play included. Although it doesn't shows the songs being played in a fancy way :/
but don't worry, I'm working on it :)
​
The Player also has two tabs for Albums and Songs section.
The Albums are shown but dont't display content.
​
## Prospects ##
It requires Lazy image Loading Mechanism and the screen for song being played.
this still needs a lot of improvement and functionality aditions like :-
​
making playlists;
sensing taste in music and the suggesting the songs on that;
Being able to manipulate song details and arranging files in external storage;
​
I have a lot on my mind and maybe I can't explain all :)
​
## Contributions ##
I'm open to any suggestion about features, working, efficiency improvement etc.
